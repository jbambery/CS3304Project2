Project 2
Joseph Bambery

My implementation of the Bitwise calculator follows a very similar outline to the
project specification.

My solution does not check for hex values that have a value greater than 16; i.e.
"FF" will not be parsed correctly, each parsed hex value is one digit. I did this
based on the test cases we were given.

My solution has 2 relevant global variables, and a global variable to hold the
file pointer for the "input.txt" file. I assumed that this was ok, because the
variable was just a file, and not used in computing the result of the
expressions.

Other notes about my implementation:
 - I have an enum "Token" that identifies each valid character in a given string.

 - get_next_token() gets then next token from the file and prints each character
   in a file as it is parsed.

 - I have included a "parser.h" file with a declaration of "E()" in order to
   silence the warning about implicit function declarations for the recursive
   call to "E()" in "C()".

 - Also included, is a Makefile for an easy compilation of the project in a local
   environment.
